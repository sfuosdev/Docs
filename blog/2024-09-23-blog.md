SFU Open-Source Development Club decided to utilize a documentation tool to provide valuable resources that help students who want to start learning programming and joining software projects. We will be using Docusaurus, an open-source tool made by Meta (Facebook) and will try to provide valuable tools to them. This tool will be open to everyone at Simon Fraser University. The update with our documentation will be shown in the Blog section. This idea has been suggested by Jiin Kim and deployed by Tommy Oh.
