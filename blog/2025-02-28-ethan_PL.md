Hey I'm Ethan, a Computer Science and Business Joint Major student @ SFU. As of writing this I have been a Project Lead at SFU OS Dev for a bit over 6 months.

As a Project Lead at SFU Open Source Development, I lead the development of Financial Fast Feed (FFF), an AI-powered financial news summarization tool. My role involves leading a team in building an automated system that aggregates and distills key financial news into concise, digestible summaries, enabling investors and professionals to stay informed efficiently. I manage the project lifecycle, from ideation to implementation, ensuring seamless integration of GPT-based NLP models for accurate and real-time summarization. In addition to technical leadership, I coordinated team efforts, conducted code reviews, and optimized workflows to maintain high development standards.

Financial Fast Feed is designed to streamline the overwhelming flow of financial news by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to extract critical insights from reports, articles, and earnings calls. The platform intelligently prioritizes market-moving information, providing users with quick, high-value takeaways to make informed decisions. By combining natural language processing (NLP) with financial analytics, FFF enhances efficiency for traders, analysts, and business professionals who need real-time updates without sifting through extensive reports. This project reflects my passion for AI-driven fintech solutions and my ability to lead cross-functional teams in developing impactful, user-focused applications.

Working with SFU OS Dev has been an incredibly rewarding experience, providing me with the opportunity to collaborate with talented developers, refine my leadership skills, and contribute to impactful open-source projects. The community fosters a culture of innovation, knowledge-sharing, and hands-on learning, making it an ideal environment for anyone passionate about software development. Leading Financial Fast Feed within this group has not only strengthened my technical expertise but also reinforced my ability to drive a project from concept to execution. I'm grateful for the experience and the team, and I look forward to seeing the continued growth of SFU OS Dev and its contributions to the open-source ecosystem.
