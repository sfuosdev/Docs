# Why Code Styling is Important

Good code styling is crucial for creating software that is readable, maintainable, and efficient to develop. Code is read far more often than it is written, which means well-styled code makes it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand and modify it later. Proper styling can also help to minimize bugs and reduce onboarding time for new developers joining a project.

## How Messy Code Affects Projects

Messy code, also known as spaghetti code, is code that is difficult to follow and understand due to poor styling, inconsistent conventions, and lack of proper documentation. Such code can cause significant problems for any project:

Harder to Debug: When code is cluttered and inconsistent, finding and fixing bugs becomes a cumbersome task. A lack of structure makes it hard to pinpoint where issues are occurring.

Difficult to Maintain: As projects grow, messy code becomes increasingly hard to manage. Small changes can have unexpected consequences, and modifying existing features can introduce new bugs due to the tangled nature of the code.

Onboarding Challenges: New developers joining a project with poor code styling often struggle to understand the existing codebase. This leads to longer onboarding times and increased chances of mistakes as new team members attempt to understand how things work.

Increased Technical Debt: Messy code contributes to technical debt, meaning future development becomes more costly and time-consuming. Eventually, poorly styled code may need to be entirely rewritten, which can stall progress and delay releases.

Poor Performance: Messy code often lacks optimization, as it is written without forethought or structure. This can lead to performance bottlenecks that could have been avoided with well-structured code from the beginning.
