# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?

Git is a distrubuted version control system that enables multiple developes to work on a project simultaneously without conflicting changes. It automatically keeps track of changes to files over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions and collaborate effectively.

## Why Use Git?

- **Version Control**: Git aids in the management of changes to files and tracks the history of all changes. This gives developers the ability to revert to earlier versions if necessary.
- **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project concurrently without interfering with each other's work.
- **Branching**: Create a new branch for each new feature, bug fix, or any change, allowing you to work independently from the main codebase until your changes are ready to be merged.
- **Merging**: Git provides powerful tools for merging changes from different branches, helping to resolve conflicts that may arise from concurrent development.

## Key Features

- **Distributed System**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, allowing them to work offline and commit changes locally.
- **Speed**: Git is designed to be fast, enabling quick operations like commits, branches, and merges.
- **Staging Area**: Git has a staging area where you can prepare your commits, allowing you to control what changes to include in your next commit.
- **Open Source**: Git is free and open-source, supported by a large community of developers which is also a key foundation to the SFU OS Dev Club.
