# Executive Documentations

SFU Open-Source Development is a student club at SFU aimed at bringing together talented individuals from tech, design, and business. Our primary goal is to collaborate on projects that contribute to the community while providing valuable learning opportunities for our members.

This documentation will talk about general policies that executives need to follow, the description and requirements of each executive position, and good-to-have skills for executives.

This is for current executives for reference but also for people who want to apply for executive positions.

DO NOT EDIT this documentation section except presidents of the club.
