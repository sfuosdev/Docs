# Introduction

Welcome to SFU Open Source Development Club! We are an official student club at Simon Fraser University aimed at bringing talented individuals from technology, design, and business. This documentation tool is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), open source tool made by Meta (Facebook).

## Purpose of this tool

This tool has been designed to support current and future students in Computer Science, Software Systems, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science Minor, as well as anyone interested in starting their journey in Computer Science. Our goal is to provide valuable resources that will help individuals excel in group projects and stay ahead in their academic and professional endeavours. In our club documentation tool, there will be topics that you need to know for software development, such as how to use git, software development cycle, etc. We hope you learn a lot from this and impact future software projects!
