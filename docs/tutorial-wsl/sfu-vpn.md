# Why VPN is crucial
A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** is crucial because it protects your online privacy and security by encrypting your internet connection, hiding your IP address, and preventing unauthorized access to your data. It is especially vital when using public Wi-Fi, as it safeguards against hackers and cyber threats. Additionally, a VPN allows you to bypass geographical restrictions, access region-locked content, and avoid censorship, ensuring an open and secure internet experience.

## What is MFA?
Multi-Factor Authentication, or MFA for short is an authentication method that requires the user to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account, or a VPN.

## How does MFA work?
MFA works by requiring additional verification information (factors). One of the most common MFA factors that users encounter are one-time passwords (OTP). OTPs are those 4-8 digit codes that you often receive via email, SMS or some sort of mobile app. With OTPs a new code is generated periodically or each time an authentication request is submitted.
