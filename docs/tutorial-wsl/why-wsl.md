# Why You Should Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature in Windows that allows users to run a full Linux environment without the need for a virtual machine or dual booting. Here's why you should consider using WSL:

---

## **1. Best of Both Worlds**
WSL lets you combine the strengths of both Windows and Linux:
- **Windows:** Continue using Windows applications like Office or Photoshop.
- **Linux:** Gain access to Linux-native tools, shell scripting, and utilities.

---

## **2. Lightweight and Fast**
- **No Virtualization Overhead:** Unlike traditional VMs, WSL doesn't require allocating hardware resources like RAM or CPU.
- **Instant Startup:** WSL launches immediately, providing near-instant access to Linux.

---

## **3. Developer-Friendly**
WSL is a fantastic tool for developers who want to:
- Run Linux tools and scripts directly on Windows.
- Use package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf` to install software.
- Develop in Linux-optimized languages like Python, Node.js, or Ruby.

---

## **5. Supports Modern Development Tools**
- Use tools like Git, Vim, and Emacs natively in WSL.
- Leverage DevOps workflows with Ansible, Terraform, and Kubernetes.
- Run data science tools and machine learning frameworks in a Linux environment.

---

## **6. Cost-Effective**
- Completely free and included with Windows.
- No need to purchase additional hardware or software.

---
## **7. Course Requirements**
- Courses such at **CMPT 125**, **CMPT 130**, **CMPT 135**, **CMPT 225** requires Linux to do Assignments and Projects.

---

## **Who Should Use WSL?**
- **Web Developers:** Optimize workflows with Linux tools and environments.
- **Data Scientists:** Use Python and ML tools natively on Linux.
- **System Admins:** Test and run Linux scripts directly on Windows.
- **Linux Enthusiasts:** Explore Linux without leaving Windows.
