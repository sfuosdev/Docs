# Why You Should Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature in Windows that allows users to run a full Linux environment without the need for a virtual machine or dual booting. Here's why you should consider using WSL:

---

## **1. Lightweight and Fast**
- **No Virtualization Overhead:** Unlike traditional VMs, WSL doesn't require allocating hardware resources like RAM or CPU.
- **Instant Startup:** WSL launches immediately, providing near-instant access to Linux.

---

## **2. Developer-Friendly**
WSL is a fantastic tool for developers who want to:
- Run Linux tools and scripts directly on Windows.
- Develop in Linux-optimized languages like Python, Node.js, or Ruby.

---
## **3. Course / Work Requirements**
- Courses such at **CMPT 125**, **CMPT 130**, **CMPT 135**, **CMPT 225** requires Linux to do Assignments and Projects.
- Coops may manage servers, **Security**, **Embedded**, **Systems** with **Linux**
---

## **Who Should Use WSL?**
- **Web Developers:** Optimize workflows with Linux tools and environments.
- **Data Scientists:** Use Python and ML tools natively on Linux.
- **System Admins:** Test and run Linux scripts directly on Windows.
- **Linux Enthusiasts:** Explore Linux without leaving Windows.
