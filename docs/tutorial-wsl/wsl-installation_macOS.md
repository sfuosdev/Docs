# What is Linux(WSL)?
Linux (WSL), or the Windows Subsystem for Linux, is a feature in Windows that allows you to run Linux directly on your Windows computer without needing a virtual machine or dual-boot setup. It gives you access to a Linux terminal where you can use Linux commands, run scripts, and even install software from Linux distributions like Ubuntu or Debian. WSL is popular among developers and system administrators because it combines the convenience of Windows with the power of Linux, making tasks like coding, testing, and automating processes much easier.

## MacOS Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Installation Guide

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:
- **macOS 10.13 or later**
- **Safari 12+, Firefox 78.1+, chrome 87+**



## Virtual Machines
The best way to utilize **Linux** in MacOS is to use a Virutal machine. \
The following list are tools you can use to use Linux on MacOS
 - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 - [Parallels Desktop](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=PDfM%20-%20B%20-%20EN%20-%20PS%20-%20Tier1%20-%20Consolidated&utm_term=parallels%20desktop&utm_content=General&utm_id=43693686&extensionid=&matchtype=e&device=c&devicemodel=&creative=670597955224&network=g&placement=&x-source=ppc&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-aK8BhCDARIsAL_-H9lFedZ818kCuJZZlEgaKsgUODiQpwheGeihp-XNp575bqQvPgHIAKAaAjVvEALw_wcB)
 - [VMware Fusion](https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html)
 - [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)
 
 There are many Virtual Machines out in the market but we personally recommand using **UTM** as it is free of use and it is macOS-native (Pre-installed)
